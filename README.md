## Feature
* Get the latest data from the server,and show it on the beautiful CardView.
* The pull-refresh is very fun and beautiful , thanks [Phoenix](https://github.com/Yalantis/Phoenix).
* If you have installed Chrome and set it as the default browser, then your browsing effect will be very cool, I  recommend you to install Chrome. If you do not install it, it does not matter, the data will be shown on the traditional WebView!
